Angels from the realms of glory
Wing your flight o'er all the earth;
Ye who sang creation's story
Now proclaim Messiah's birth:
</div><div class="stanza">
Come and worship, come and worship
Worship Christ, the newborn King.

Shepherds, in the fields abiding,
Watching o'er your flocks by night,
God with man is now residing,
Yonder shines the infant light:

Come and worship, come and worship
Worship Christ, the newborn King.
</div><div class="stanza">
Sages, leave your contemplations
Brighter visions beam afar,
Seek the great Desire of nations,
Ye have seen his natal star:
</div><div class="stanza">
Come and worship, come and worship
Worship Christ, the newborn King.
</div><div class="stanza">
Though an infant now we view him,
He shall fill his Father's throne,
Gather all the nations to him,
Every knee shall then bow down:
</div><div class="stanza">
Come and worship, come and worship
Worship Christ, the newborn King.
</div><div class="stanza">
All creation, join in praising
God the Father, Spirit, Son,
Evermore your voices raising,
To eternal Three in One:

Come and worship, come and worship
Worship Christ, the newborn King.

It came upon a midnight clear,
That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth,
To touch their harps of gold:
"Peace on the earth, goodwill to men,
From heaven's all-gracious King."
The world in solemn stillness lay,
To hear the angels sing.

Still through the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurled,
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world;
Above its sad and lowly plains,
They bend on hovering wing,
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessèd angels sing.
</div><div class="stanza">
Yet with the woes of sin and strife
The world has suffered long;
Beneath the heavenly hymn have rolled
Two thousand years of wrong;
And man, at war with man, hears not
The love-song which they bring;
O hush the noise, ye men of strife,
And hear the angels sing.
</div><div class="stanza">
And you, beneath life's crushing load
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow,
Look now! for glad and golden hours
come swiftly on the wing.
O rest beside the weary road,
And hear the angels sing!
</div><div class="stanza">
For lo!, the days are hastening on,
By prophets seen of old
When with the ever-circling years
Comes round the age of gold
When peace shall over all the earth
Its ancient splendors fling,
And the whole world give back the song
Which now the angels sing.

"Sire, the night is darker now, and the wind blows stronger;
Fails my heart, I know not how; I can go no longer."

Thou shalt find the winter's rage freeze thy blood less coldly."

In his master's steps he trod, where the snow lay dinted;

          <h1>Frosty The Snowman</h1>

          <div class="lyrics">
<div class="stanza">
Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul,
With a corncob pipe and a button nose,
And two eyes made out of coal.
</div><div class="stanza">
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say,
He was made of snow but the children
know how he came to life one day.
</div><div class="stanza">
There must have been some magic in that
Old silk hat they found.
For when they placed it on his head,
He began to dance around.
</div><div class="stanza">
Oh, Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be,
And the children say he could laugh
And play just the same as you and me.
</div><div class="stanza">
Thumpetty thump thump, (x2)
Look at Frosty go.
Thumpetty thump thump, (x2)
Over the hills of snow.
</div><div class="stanza">
Frosty the snowman knew
The sun was hot that day,
So he said, 'Let's run and
we'll have some fun
now before I melt away.'
Down to the village,
With a broomstick in his hand,
Running here and there all
Around the square saying,
Catch me if you can.
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop.
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler 'Stop!'
</div><div class="stanza">
For Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way,
But he waved goodbye saying,
'Don't you cry,
I'll be back again some day.'
</div><div class="stanza">
Thumpetty thump thump,  (x2)
Look at Frosty go.
</div><div class="stanza">
Thumpetty thump thump, (x2)
Over the hills of snow.

Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
had a very shiny nose.

All of the other reindeer

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight.
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
</div><div class="stanza">
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
</div><div class="stanza">
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.
</div><div class="stanza">
Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
</div><div class="stanza">
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kids knock him down.
</div><div class="stanza">
When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire,
Jack Frost nipping on your nose,
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir,
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe,
Help to make the season bright.
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow,
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.
</div><div class="stanza">
They know that Santa's on his way;
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh.
And every mother's child is going to spy,
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.
</div><div class="stanza">
And so I'm offering this simple phrase,
To kids from one to ninety-two,
Although its been said many times, many ways,
A very Merry Christmas to you
