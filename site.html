Angels from the realms of glory
Wing your flight o'er all the earth;
Ye who sang creation's story
Now proclaim Messiah's birth:
</div><div class="stanza">
Come and worship, come and worship
Worship Christ, the newborn King.
</div><div class="stanza">
Shepherds, in the fields abiding,
Watching o'er your flocks by night,
God with man is now residing,
Yonder shines the infant light:
</div><div class="stanza">
Come and worship, come and worship
Worship Christ, the newborn King.
</div><div class="stanza">
Sages, leave your contemplations
Brighter visions beam afar,
Seek the great Desire of nations,
Ye have seen his natal star:
</div><div class="stanza">
Come and worship, come and worship
Worship Christ, the newborn King.
</div><div class="stanza">
Though an infant now we view him,
He shall fill his Father's throne,
Gather all the nations to him,
Every knee shall then bow down:
</div><div class="stanza">
Come and worship, come and worship
Worship Christ, the newborn King.
</div><div class="stanza">
All creation, join in praising
God the Father, Spirit, Son,
Evermore your voices raising,
To eternal Three in One:

Come and worship, come and worship
Worship Christ, the newborn King.

On Mary's lap is sleeping,

It came upon a midnight clear,
That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth,
To touch their harps of gold:
"Peace on the earth, goodwill to men,
From heaven's all-gracious King."
The world in solemn stillness lay,
To hear the angels sing.
</div><div class="stanza">
Still through the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurled,
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world;
Above its sad and lowly plains,
They bend on hovering wing,
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessèd angels sing.
</div><div class="stanza">
Yet with the woes of sin and strife
The world has suffered long;
Beneath the heavenly hymn have rolled
Two thousand years of wrong;
And man, at war with man, hears not
The love-song which they bring;
O hush the noise, ye men of strife,
And hear the angels sing.
</div><div class="stanza">
And you, beneath life's crushing load
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow,
Look now! for glad and golden hours
come swiftly on the wing.
O rest beside the weary road,
And hear the angels sing!
</div><div class="stanza">
For lo!, the days are hastening on,
By prophets seen of old
When with the ever-circling years
Comes round the age of gold
When peace shall over all the earth
Its ancient splendors fling,
And the whole world give back the song
Which now the angels sing.

Good King Wenceslas looked out, on the Feast of Stephen,

"Hither, page, and stand by me, if thou know'st it, telling,

"Bring me flesh, and bring me wine, bring me pine logs hither:
Thou and I shall see him dine, when we bear them thither."

"Sire, the night is darker now, and the wind blows stronger;
Fails my heart, I know not how; I can go no longer."
"Mark my footsteps, good my page. Tread thou in them boldly
Thou shalt find the winter's rage freeze thy blood less coldly."

In his master's steps he trod, where the snow lay dinted;
